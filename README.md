### Meal recipe app
# Here is basic static app implementation.
 ## New things which I learned throughout implementation:
 * fetch API
 * Bootstrap 5
 * Vanilla Javascript
 * Grid, responsive design
 * Generation of elements on HTML page using JS

Overall, here are some functions which can be added :
* add products page to have transactions (PHP)
* add login/ authentication for user
* add DB for better user experience

Have fun!
